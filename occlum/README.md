# Run gVisor syscall tests on Occlum

- Prepare bazel for gVisor installation, run
```
./prepare_bazel.sh
```

- To build the syscall tests, run
```
./build_and_install_syscall_tests.sh
```
The test binaries will be output to `/opt/occlum/gvisor_syscall_tests`.

- To directly run the tests on host, run 
```
./run_all_tests_on_host.sh
```

- To directly run the tests on occlum, run 
```
./run_all_tests_on_occlum.sh
```
Since not all the tests are passed in occlum, failure may be encountered.

- Run passed tests on occlum, run
```
./run_occlum_passed_tests.sh
```
- Run passed tests on ngo, run
```
./run_occlum_passed_tests.sh ngo
```

To add a test that are passed in occlum, put the name to `occlum_test_list.txt`. Sometimes, not all the subtests in a test can be passed. Add the failed subtests to the file in foler `blocklist`. Then, the failed subtests will not be run.

# Run single test case for Occlum/NGO

After building the syscall tests, run:
```
./single_test.sh -p <occlum/ngo> -s <test suite> [-t <test case>] [-r <repeat times>] [-l <log file>]
```
